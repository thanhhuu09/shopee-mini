# Task 003 - Cart Review & Totals

## Scope
- Implement dedicated cart page showing line items, editable quantities, remove controls, subtotal, and checkout CTA.
- Persist cart server-side or via API route to facilitate future checkout order creation.
- Surface validation errors if cart is empty or invalid before allowing checkout.

## Acceptance
- `/cart` reflects cart state after add/remove operations and recalculates totals instantly.
- Updating quantities enforces inventory limits and updates totals without page refresh.
- Lint and build pass; include unit/integration tests for cart reducer or server actions if added.

## Commands
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
