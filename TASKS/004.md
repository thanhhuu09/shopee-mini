# Task 004 - Admin Product CRUD

## Scope
- Build admin dashboard guarded by credential gate (basic auth or password screen) accessible at `/admin`.
- Implement CRUD UI for products including form validation for title, price, currency, inventory, and media URLs.
- Ensure updates persist to the same data layer used by storefront catalog.

## Acceptance
- Unauthorized users hitting `/admin` are blocked until they provide the configured credential.
- Admin list view shows all products with edit/delete controls; create/edit forms validate fields and persist changes.
- Lint and build pass; include smoke tests or stories demonstrating CRUD interactions if available.

## Commands
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
