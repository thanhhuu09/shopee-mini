# Task 001 - Catalog Foundation

## Scope
- Build Product model scaffolding (types, repository abstraction, mock data loader).
- Implement storefront catalog route listing active products with title, price, thumbnail, and CTA to view details.
- Include loading/empty/error states per PRD MVP scope.

## Acceptance
- Catalog page renders at `/` using data from repository and hides inactive products.
- Basic responsive grid works on mobile and desktop without layout shift >100ms during load.
- Lint and build succeed with new Catalog components, and component tests (if any) pass.

## Commands
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
