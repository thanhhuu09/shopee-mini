# Task 002 - Product Detail & Add to Cart

## Scope
- Create product detail route by slug showing gallery, pricing, description, stock, and quantity selector.
- Wire add-to-cart action that writes to client-side cart store (App Router server + client components as needed).
- Handle validation when requested quantity exceeds available inventory.

## Acceptance
- Navigating from catalog item leads to `/products/[slug]` with accurate product data.
- Add-to-cart updates cart badge/count and persists selection in session storage or server cache.
- Lint, build, and any unit tests covering quantity validation all pass.

## Commands
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
