# Task 005 - Checkout, Admin QA, and Playwright Smoke

## Scope
- Implement checkout flow collecting contact, shipping, and payment method, creating Order + OrderItems from cart contents.
- Render success page with order summary and reusable order identifier for confirmation URL sharing.
- Finalize admin CRUD from Task 004 with server-side validation hooks plus optimistic storefront revalidation.
- Author Playwright smoke tests covering buyer journey (catalog -> detail -> cart -> checkout -> success) and admin CRUD sanity (create/edit/delete).

## Acceptance
- Checkout rejects invalid form submissions, creates persisted order on success, clears cart, and redirects to `/success/[orderNumber]`.
- Admin CRUD actions emit errors when validation fails and succeed when valid, with storefront immediately reflecting changes.
- Playwright suite runs headless in CI, verifying both storefront flow and admin CRUD at least once, and is wired into default test command.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and Playwright smoke all pass in CI for PR merge.

## Commands
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `npx playwright test` (or project-specific smoke command once defined)
